## Game ideas

#### triple dice can either score for you or against a single opponent. 
This allows you to drag back a runaway leader and forces you to eliminate at least a player or two before you can thrash out a points victory.
 
#### Raised from the dead! 
Every player has two lives. Not the same as double life score (raises still can't exceed maximum 10 health etc). 
The monster gets to come back as a Zombie (zombie bunny, zombie gigazaur, etc). Zombies must eat 'braiiiins' at least once a round (ie, attack) or lose a health point.

#### you get a point every time any player starts a round whilst you're in Tokyo. 
This makes Tokyo worth holding, but balances against point attacks. We find it fleshes out the game to the point where powers have more of an influence 
and Tokyo worth holding.

#### Instead of taking your character's evolution deck, we set up a card draft for the evolutions. 
It mixes up the game a bit, allows a little bit of extra strategy, and breaks up some of the overpowered decks a bit.
It also lets you choose your character without having to consider whether their evolutions are any good.
